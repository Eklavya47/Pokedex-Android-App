The Pokedex App uses Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for its UI and logic builiding. It uses Retrofit to make an api call and get the data of pokemons and then it shows them in the form of grid view. It has a search functionality which can be used to search for any specific pokemon and pagination is also implemented so that only few pokemons is fetched at a time to optimize performance. Below are some of the screenshots.
